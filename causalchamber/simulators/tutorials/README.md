# Simulator tutorials

- Each notebook contains a simple tutorial for each simulator.
- The Python requirements to run the notebooks are detailed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
- The directory [example_scripts/](example_scripts) contains the notebooks exported as Python scripts, which are ran as part of the tests for the `causalchamber` package.
